# Brighter Recipe Finder
Have you ever looked in your fridge and wondered what in the world you are going to make with that? 
How about seeing the chicken you pulled out to thaw a couple days ago and now need to actually cook?

This robust recipe finder allows you to input anything you want and you will get recipe suggestions in response!
Input options include:
  A list of ingredients
  A single ingredient
  A food pun you heard last week from your dad

# Development Environment

I developed this application in VS Code using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. For some of the trivial CSS, the CSS 
framework Bootstrap was used. For the major animations and most hover effects, I created some local CSS to support those.

This site leverages two api's to dynamically populate its information:
  [Nutrition API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/nutrition)
  [Tasty](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/tasty)

# Useful Websites

- [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/)
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animations)

# Future Work

- Add Pages to display more of the JSON information (price, video source, etc)
