# Grocery-Tracker
Have you ever looked at the weekly ad and wondered if this 2 5lb bag of potatoes for $5 deal is really a good deal? Was $2 for 6oz of blackberries what I got last time, or was it $2 for 12oz?
This application allows you to keep track of how much you spend on each item in the grocery store so you can see your trends in purchasing.
